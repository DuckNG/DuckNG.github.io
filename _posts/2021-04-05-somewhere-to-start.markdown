There's been a number of times over the years where I've wanted a place to write something after working on a particular project, feature or finding something unexpected. Before today I haven't had a place for that. I didn't want to publish on any platform, but just hadn't taken the time to setup something of my own.

A little while back I saw an experiment [HEY][hey-world] was running for blogging and that got me thinking about setting up something for myself again. I already had a repo setup on Github Pages, so I started with a really simple question, `What works well with Github Pages?`. Almost immediately I came across [Jekyll][jekyll]. Since I already work with ruby every day, it appeared to be a very quick way to get started, so here I am.

While this may not be quite as quick to get going as HEY World, it was pretty painless. In just a short time I went from having nothing, to a published blog. The only small hiccup I ran into was Github notifying me that my DNS records were pointing to an outdated IP address. That was a simple enough fix, and I got enforced SSL out of the deal with the click of a checkbox.

Now going forward anytime I want to write something no matter how small and put it out into the world, it becomes nothing more than create a file, write and commit using tools I already use everyday.
